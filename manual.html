        <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>The LP-1500 was designed to fill a unique space in the market. The intention was to build a simple, yet very powerful desk for use in a wide variety of applications. The board must be usable with zero training for the rental market, yet the needs
            of a sophisticated owner in a theatre or club setting.
        </p>
        <p>The approach taken with the design and layout of the board is similar to the approach used with the LP-2000 and Cue Plus options. The basic board operations are simple, and effects can be turned on and used as time and experience allows. The result
            is that the LP-1500 consists of four independent sections</p>
        <p>The first is a basic two-scene console. Using the dipless crossfader, scenes are alternated between the two manual presets. Bump buttons and led indicators make the LP-1500 very capable even in this non-memory mode of use.</p>
        <p>The next step is to use the Preset Master feature of the board. Setting the Y / Presets switch to the Presets position will convert the lower scene to a bank of independent scenes with 12 pages of memory. This is the memory mode most useful for
            live music, or any show that requires maximum cue changes with minimum setup time.</p>
        <p>For more memory, or running a theatrical type of presentation, the Cue Stack can be activated. This provides automatic timed fades, with manual override and link/loop possibilities. Also, cues can be inserted to give &quot;point cues&quot;, a
            very powerful feature in a board of this type.</p>
        <p>The fourth control section is the Chaser. It is used to build free running patterns or sequences. For simplicity of operation, pre-recorded patterns are included, as well as the capability to program custom patterns</p>
        <p>A two line 16 character display and a rotating data wheel is used in all operational modes to display and edit board parameters. The operation of the board is intended to be logical and consistent regardless of operating modes. In all cases, control
            screens will consist of a top title line, which is a display-only field. The cursor will move laterally only across the bottom line of the display. The data wheel is used to move left and right through a linear row of screens. When a parameter
            is in view, the Modify button next to the display can be used to alter the displayed value.</p>

    <article id="specifications">
        <h2>Specifications</h2>
        <ul id="specifications-list">
            <li>Manual capacity:</li>
            <p>Two scene preset with twelve, twenty-four or thirty-six channels. Switchable Add or Solo momentary buttons for each channel. Split dipless crossfade between manual scenes. Each channel has an led output indicator.</p>
            <li>Preset Memory:</li>
            <p>Twelve, twenty-four or thirty-six real-time preset faders with switchable Add or Solo bumps. Presets may be &quot;piled on&quot; in any combination. Presets are assigned to one of twelve memory pages by means of a rotary page select switch.
                A preview mode allows cues to be checked without bringing up the scene on stage. An existing cue may easily be edited using the manual scene faders without re-recording the entire cue.</p>
            <li>Cue Stack:</li>
            <p>288 programmable cues with crossfader and go button control. Fade times can be set for each scene, and scenes may be linked in any order for playback. A two line LCD is used to display current and next cues, and all other parameters.</p>
            <li>Chaser:</li>
            <p>Four fixed and seven programmable patterns of up to twenty steps each are provided. All programmable patterns are fully proportional, and are recorded, previewed and edited as easily as the preset cues. The rate of each pattern may be saved
                with the chase, eliminating the need to adjust the rate pot when the chase is recalled. The chase may be advanced a step at a time manually, or halted momentarily. Chases may be assigned to a preset fader, automatically starting the selected
                chase when the scene is faded up.</p>
            <li>Soft Patch:</li>
            <p>One standard and two user programmable soft patches allow assignment of up to 256 dimmers via DMX. All analog channels in the board are patched with the DMX channels.</p>
            <li>Output:</li>
            <p>Standard consoles support two digital protocols and one analog output. The analog out is 0-10 vdc; Jones type connectors are used. Options available for the analog connector are Socapex 37 pin or 25 pin subminiature D connector. The digital
                output can be selected by the user as either DMX 512 with the standard 5 pin XLR as specified by USITT, or MIDI by means of 5 pin Din connector. The analog output operates simultaneously with either selected digital protocol</p>
            <li>Construction:</li>
            <p>All aluminum chassis for durability and lightweight. Angled shape makes the controls easier to see and operate, and gives a distinctive profile. Littlite work lamp with power supply and dimmer is standard.
            </p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>The LP-1500 series consoles connect easily to most types of dimming systems. Analog, DMX 512 and MIDI outputs are provided for dimmer control. The flexibility to interface to old or new systems makes the LP-1500 a natural choice for building a
            new system, or replacing a tired, old controller.</p>
        <section id="power-requirements">
            <h3>Power Requirements</h3>
            <p>The LP-1500 console is powered from a separate power supply that must be connected to a 120 volt, 60 Hertz AC power source. This is the standard for most electrical outlets in the United States. The LP-1500 draws less than two amps of current;
                extension cords as small as 18 gauge can be used for board power.
            </p>
            <p>If the board is to be used with European power systems, or other 220 volt applications, contact your Leprecon dealer for the optional 220 volt power supply.</p>
            <p>Because temporary power distribution is usually set up for portable lighting systems, it is possible to accidentally connect the console to a higher line voltage, or to a source where two of the three line wires (for example, the hot wire
                and the ground wire) have been swapped. Some protection from such accidents has been designed into the LP-1500, but serious damage to the board and operator can result from incorrect power connections. It is recommended that when the console
                is used in a touring system, the power feed should be checked before the board is plugged in.</p>
            <p>
                The LP-1500 is a microprocessor-based console. Like all digital equipment, it can be affected by electrical noise and spikes on the power lines. For this reason, it is recommended that the console be plugged into a separate circuit from other devices.
                This also prevents other equipment from tripping the breaker that supplies power to the console. It is suggested as well that the LP-1500 be plugged into a line filter / surge suppressor of the type commonly used for personal computers.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="connecting-to-dimmers">
            <h3>Connecting To Dimmers</h3>
            <p>The LP-1500 is designed to be used with a wide range of dimmer systems. Two different digital protocols have been implemented, and the user must first select which protocol is being used. To do this, press the Setup menu button under the display.
                The LP-1500 will show the first setup screen:
                <figure id="first-setup-screen">
                </figure>
                Rotate the data wheel to the right until the following display is seen:
                <figure id="second-setup-screen">
                </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
                A pointer will be seen next to one of the selections, indicating the active output. To change output protocols, press and hold the Modify button and turn the data wheel. The pointer will move from one position to the other. When you have selected the
                correct output protocol, release the modify button.
            </p>
            <h4 class="unindexed-headings">DMX Output</h4>
            <p>
                The 5 pin DMX 512 digital output on the rear panel offers a fast and reliable way of sending control information to the stage. Simply connect a standard 5-wire control cable from the console jack to the DMX connector on the dimmer. As the standard mandates,
                the LP-1500 has a female connector. Additional dimmers can be &quot;daisy-chained&quot; from the first dimmer, by running additional cables between the dimmers.</p>
            <p>
                The LP-1500 has been tested and complies fully with the USITT DMX 512 / 1900 standard, and should pose no compatibility problems with any DMX 512 dimmers from Leprecon or from other manufacturers. Should any suspected incompatibilities be encountered,
                please contact Leprecon with the specific dimmer model and manufacturer.</p>
            <h4 class="unindexed-headings">MIDI Output</h4>
            <p>
                The LP-1500 can also be used to control dimmers that use MIDI as a control input, such as the Leprecon LD-360M. Although MIDI was originally devised as a system of interconnecting musical Patch Label #0 Default Dimmer Output DMX MIDI 7 equipment, it lends
                itself well to lighting applications in small systems. Because of the lower data rate of MIDI, the total number of dimmers that can be driven is limited to 100.
            </p>
            <h4 class="unindexed-headings">Analog Output</h4>
            <p>
                Even with the advent of digital control standards, many portable lighting systems use analog control lines between the console and the dimmer racks. The LP-1500 provides 0-10 volt analog outputs, using a Cinch-Jones connector. Optional analog outputs
                include 37 pin Socapex or 25 pin subminiature &quot;D&quot; connectors.</p>

        <section id="softpatch">
            <h3>Soft Patch</h3>
            <p>
                The LP-1500 console includes Softpatch, where two custom assignments of dimmer circuits to console channels, in addition to a default &quot;straight&quot; patch assignment, are stored for instant recall.</p>
            <p>
                The custom patches allow the assignment of any dimmer circuit to a specific console channel. Up to 256 DMX dimmer channels can be assigned to any of the board channels. All analog channels installed can also be patched. More than one dimmer circuit may
                be assigned to a single console channel; in other words, the channel 8 fader on the console might bring up dimmer circuits 8, 16, and 32. However, a dimmer circuit can be controlled by only one console channel. A dimmer can be disconnected
                from the system by assigning it to the non-existent channel 0. To reduce unnecessary delay in the system, unused channels should remain patched to channel 0.</p>
            <p>
                To access the softpatch features, press the button labeled &quot;Setup&quot; below the LCD window. The yellow led above the button will light, and the display will show the first Setup screen.
            </p>
            <figure id="pg-12-fig1"></figure>
            <p>
                Along with the patch number is a field that can be used to label each patch. The #1 patch is a nonalterable 1:1 patch; the label &quot;DEFAULT&quot; and the patch table itself cannot be edited. Patches 1 and 2 are custom patch tables, the label and the
                channel assignment must be entered by the user.</p>
            <p>
                To select a new patch, move the cursor until it is directly under the digit following the # sign. Hold the &quot;Modify&quot; button down and rotate the wheel until the new number is displayed. Releasing the &quot;modify&quot; button saves the new value.
                The label following the number can modified in the same way, one letter at a time, to title the custom patch.
            </p>
            <h4 class="unindexed-headings">Displaying and Editing a Custom Patch</h4>
            <p>Scrolling further to the right of the active patch menu will display the patch assignment screen. An example is shown below:</p>
            <figure id="pg-12-fig2"></figure>
            <p>
                The number listed below the word &quot;Dimmer&quot; represents the dimmer circuit. Any dimmer number can be displayed by holding the Modify button, and turning the data wheel to the right for higher numbers and to the left for lower dimmer circuit numbers.
                To the right, under the word &quot;Channel&quot;, will appear the number of the board channel that the dimmer is assigned to. To alter this assignment, locate the cursor under the channel number, hold the modify button, and turn the data
                wheel. When the number is set, and the wheel released, the new value will be stored in memory.</p>
            <p>
                When patching is finished, pressing the Run mode button will return the console to the run mode display, and indicate this by turning off the yellow led above the Setup button.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="clearing-memory">
            <h3>Clearing Memory</h3>
            <p>
                Cues, chases and patches recorded into the LP-1500 are stored in battery-backed memory. The lithium coin cell that is used will retain memory in the console for a minimum of 1 year.</p>
            <p>
                When starting to program a new show, it is easier to start with an empty board. The Erase function in the LP-1500 can be used to delete all cues, chases and patches, leaving the scenes empty and ready to program. All fade times, links and delay times
                will also be cleared, and default values will be inserted for these parameters in all locations.</p>
            <p>
                Three screens are provided for the Erase function. The user can elect to erase all scenes, including Presets and Cue Stack memories. The custom chases (chases 5-11) can be cleared by themselves, keeping all scene memories intact. The final screen allows
                ALL MEMORY of the LP- 1500 to be cleared.</p>
            <p>
                To clear ALL memory in the LP-1500, start by pressing the Setup menu button. Turn the data wheel to the right, until the following message is seen:</p>
            <figure id="pg-13-fig1"></figure>
            <p>
                To proceed with the erase, press the Modify button. If you get cold feet, press any other button, such as the Run button. Assuming that you really do want to clear all memory, and you have pressed the Modify button, one last warning will be issued.</p>
            <figure id="pg-13-fig2"></figure>
            <p>
                Pressing the Record button at this prompt will definitely clear all the information in the console. Once this has been done, the data is gone for good. The LP-1500 will verify this:</p>
            <figure id="pg-13-fig3"></figure>
            <p>
                In the case of erasing ONLY presets, or ONLY chases, use the appropriate screen in the Setup menu. The procedure of pressing Modify, then pressing Record, is the same regardless of the data being erased. The Preset Erase screen looks like this:</p>
            <figure id="pg-13-fig4"></figure>
            <p>
                The erase screen for the programmable chases reads as follows:

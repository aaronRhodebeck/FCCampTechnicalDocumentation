        <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>The LP-1500 was designed to fill a unique space in the market. The intention was to build a simple, yet very powerful desk for use in a wide variety of applications. The board must be usable with zero training for the rental market, yet the needs
            of a sophisticated owner in a theatre or club setting.
        </p>
        <p>The approach taken with the design and layout of the board is similar to the approach used with the LP-2000 and Cue Plus options. The basic board operations are simple, and effects can be turned on and used as time and experience allows. The result
            is that the LP-1500 consists of four independent sections</p>
        <p>The first is a basic two-scene console. Using the dipless crossfader, scenes are alternated between the two manual presets. Bump buttons and led indicators make the LP-1500 very capable even in this non-memory mode of use.</p>
        <p>The next step is to use the Preset Master feature of the board. Setting the Y / Presets switch to the Presets position will convert the lower scene to a bank of independent scenes with 12 pages of memory. This is the memory mode most useful for
            live music, or any show that requires maximum cue changes with minimum setup time.</p>
        <p>For more memory, or running a theatrical type of presentation, the Cue Stack can be activated. This provides automatic timed fades, with manual override and link/loop possibilities. Also, cues can be inserted to give “point cues”, a very powerful
            feature in a board of this type.</p>
        <p>The fourth control section is the Chaser. It is used to build free running patterns or sequences. For simplicity of operation, pre-recorded patterns are included, as well as the capability to program custom patterns</p>
        <p>A two line 16 character display and a rotating data wheel is used in all operational modes to display and edit board parameters. The operation of the board is intended to be logical and consistent regardless of operating modes. In all cases, control
            screens will consist of a top title line, which is a display-only field. The cursor will move laterally only across the bottom line of the display. The data wheel is used to move left and right through a linear row of screens. When a parameter
            is in view, the Modify button next to the display can be used to alter the displayed value.</p>

        <h2>Specifications</h2>
        <ul id="specifications-list">
            <li>Manual capacity:</li>
            <p>Two scene preset with twelve, twenty-four or thirty-six channels. Switchable Add or Solo momentary buttons for each channel. Split dipless crossfade between manual scenes. Each channel has an led output indicator.</p>
            <li>Preset Memory:</li>
            <p>Twelve, twenty-four or thirty-six real-time preset faders with switchable Add or Solo bumps. Presets may be “piled on” in any combination. Presets are assigned to one of twelve memory pages by means of a rotary page select switch. A preview
                mode allows cues to be checked without bringing up the scene on stage. An existing cue may easily be edited using the manual scene faders without re-recording the entire cue.</p>
            <li>Cue Stack:</li>
            <p>288 programmable cues with crossfader and go button control. Fade times can be set for each scene, and scenes may be linked in any order for playback. A two line LCD is used to display current and next cues, and all other parameters.</p>
            <li>Chaser:</li>
            <p>Four fixed and seven programmable patterns of up to twenty steps each are provided. All programmable patterns are fully proportional, and are recorded, previewed and edited as easily as the preset cues. The rate of each pattern may be saved
                with the chase, eliminating the need to adjust the rate pot when the chase is recalled. The chase may be advanced a step at a time manually, or halted momentarily. Chases may be assigned to a preset fader, automatically starting the selected
                chase when the scene is faded up.</p>
            <li>Soft Patch:</li>
            <p>One standard and two user programmable soft patches allow assignment of up to 256 dimmers via DMX. All analog channels in the board are patched with the DMX channels.</p>
            <li>Output:</li>
            <p>Standard consoles support two digital protocols and one analog output. The analog out is 0-10 vdc; Jones type connectors are used. Options available for the analog connector are Socapex 37 pin or 25 pin subminiature D connector. The digital
                output can be selected by the user as either DMX 512 with the standard 5 pin XLR as specified by USITT, or MIDI by means of 5 pin Din connector. The analog output operates simultaneously with either selected digital protocol</p>
            <li>Construction:</li>
            <p>All aluminum chassis for durability and lightweight. Angled shape makes the controls easier to see and operate, and gives a distinctive profile. Littlite work lamp with power supply and dimmer is standard.
